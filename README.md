# Battleship
This repository presents the code for the game Battleship. It was written in the Python programming language.

Rules of the game:

The game board is a 10x10 grid. Each cell is identified by a letter (A-J) and a number (1-10). You will place your ships on your board, and the computer will place its ships on its board. The ships are of different sizes: one 5-unit, one 4-unit, two 3-unit, two 2-unit, and two 1-unit ships. Ships cannot touch each other, not even diagonally. On your turn, you will guess a coordinate to attack. If you hit a ship, you get another turn. If you miss, it's the computer's turn. The first player to sink all the opponent's ships wins.
